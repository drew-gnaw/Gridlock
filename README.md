# EnPassantEngine

Welcome to the repository for EnPassantEngine, a chess engine created using Create React App and TensorFlow.

## Overview

EnPassantEngine is a chess engine that uses a combination of a minimax algorithm and a neural network to analyze possible board states as Forsyth-Edwards Notation (FENs). The neural network is built with TensorFlow and has been trained on 400,000 positions and validated on 10,000 positions. A unique characteristic of EnPassantEngine is its affinity for the en passant move in chess, adding a unique twist to its gameplay.
